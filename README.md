# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Project Description

Constructing a server to coincide with the WTWR application that had previously been created in the last couple of sprints. Setting up routes and responses to expected requests from the client. Establishing methods for handling GET, Post, PUT, and DELETE requests with the appropriate response. As well as providing the correct error handling in the event of an error taking place.

## Technology Used

In this project we utilized such technologies as express a framework for Node.js, MongoDb a non-relational database management system (DBMS), Mongoose a third-party library for MongoDB, Postman an API testing platform, Nodemon a command-line tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application when it detects changes to the project directory. Through the use of all of these technologies we were able to utilize incredibly useful tools such as a Router to help with establishing the routes for incoming requests from the client, Schemas to configure models for documents, and various handler methods such as .find & findAndDeleteById which give us built in functions for working with data within the models.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
